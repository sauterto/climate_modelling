### Python Notebooks
* Coupled boundary layer model
  * [Solution: Coupled boundary layer model](coupled::solution)


### Exercises:


>**Task 1**: Take the heat equation from the previous chapters and
>extend it to 2 dimensions (depth x width). As a boundary condition at the
>earth's surface, couple the SEB model via the ground heat flux. Assume a
>suitable diurnal cycle for the shortwave radiation and the 2 m temperature. At
>the lower boundary we use a Neumann condition with a gradient of zero.

>**Task 2**: As a last step, we couple the soil module (SEB + Heat transport in
>soil) with the boundary layer model (Advection-diffusion equation). Consider
>different land use classes (water, land) in the soil module. Repeat the
>land-sea effect experiment with this model.
