>**Task 1**: Integrate the heat equation for several days using a time step of
>hour and a heat conductivity of  $\nu = 1.2e^{-6}$ [m$^2$ s$^{-1}$]. Plot the result.
>Once the code works, change the integration time. What happens if you
>integrate over a very long time?


>**Task 2**: Rewrite the 1D heat equation (Task 1) using index arrays.

>**Task 3**: Using the previous code, solve the Heat Equation using a temporal
>varying surface boundary condition. Use the following discretization: I = [0;
>20 m], N = 40 grid points, $\nu = 1.2e^{-6}$ [m$^2$ s$^{-1}$], and a daily time step.
>Integrate the equation for several years, e.g. 5 years. Plot the result as
>a contour plot. Also plot temperature time series in several depths. Discuss
>the plot!
